Andrew Phillips

forked from [fmccown:main](https://github.com/fmccown/scavenger)

## Description

Unity Scavenger game based on Unity tutorial [2D Roguelike](https://learn.unity.com/project/2d-roguelike-tutorial?uv=5.x).

Currently configured for Unity 2020.3.

## Changes

- Set levels to be read from files
- Created a win condition (passing all levels)
- Made text scale with the window size (on start) so text doesn't run off on smaller viewports
